                        <p>Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong? Aw, you're all Mr. Grumpy Face today. You hit me with a cricket bat.</p>
                        <p>I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me! No&hellip; It's a thing; it's like a plan, but with more greatness. Saving the world with meals on wheels. I hate yogurt. It's just stuff with bits in. All I've got to do is pass as an ordinary human being. Simple. What could possibly go wrong?</p>
                        <p>I'm nobody's taxi service; I'm not gonna be there to catch you every time you feel like jumping out of a spaceship. Did I mention we have comfy chairs? Father Christmas. Santa Claus. Or as I've always known him: Jeff.</p>
                        <p>Sorry, checking all the water in this area; there's an escaped fish. You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! Heh-haa! Super squeaky bum time! I am the last of my species, and I know how that weighs on the heart so don't lie to me!</p>
                        <p>You hate me; you want to kill me! Well, go on! Kill me! KILL ME! Saving the world with meals on wheels. I'm the Doctor. Well, they call me the Doctor. I don't know why. I call me the Doctor too. I still don't know why. They're not aliens, they're Earth&hellip;liens!</p>

                        <p>No, no, no! Yes, yes. A bit. But she's got a wart. What a strange person. I have to push the pram a lot.</p>
                        <p>But you are dressed as one&hellip; Shh! Knights, I bid you welcome to your new home. Let us ride to Camelot! Well, I didn't vote for you.</p>
                        <p>Bring her forward! Shut up! Burn her! Shut up! Well, Mercia's a temperate zone! We shall say 'Ni' again to you, if you do not appease us.</p>
                        <p>Well, she turned me into a newt. I am your king. Well, I got better. Burn her anyway! Well, we did do the nose.</p>
                        <p>You can't expect to wield supreme power just 'cause some watery tart threw a sword at you! And this isn't my nose. This is a false one. And the hat. She's a witch! Well, I got better. You don't vote for kings.</p>

                        <p>I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. Red Five standing by. You're all clear, kid. Let's blow this thing and go home! Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him.</p>
                        <p>Look, I ain't in this for your revolution, and I'm not in it for you, Princess. I expect to be well paid. I'm in it for the money. She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! Remember, a Jedi can feel the Force flowing through him. In my experience, there is no such thing as luck. The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. As you wish.</p>
                        <p>No! Alderaan is peaceful. We have no weapons. You can't possibly&hellip; Oh God, my uncle. How am I ever gonna explain this? Leave that to me. Send a distress signal, and inform the Senate that all on board were killed.</p>
                        <p>She must have hidden the plans in the escape pod. Send a detachment down to retrieve them, and see to it personally, Commander. There'll be no one to stop us this time! Obi-Wan is here. The Force is with him. Don't be too proud of this technological terror you've constructed. The ability to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force.</p>
                        <p>The plans you refer to will soon be back in our hands. I need your help, Luke. She needs your help. I'm getting too old for this sort of thing. But with the blast shield down, I can't even see! How am I supposed to fight? I call it luck. Hey, Luke! May the Force be with you.</p>
